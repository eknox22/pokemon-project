### 1. Key features

The main game loop prompts the player to choose between different game modes (Normal Mode, Difficult Mode, or Exit).
In each round, the player is presented with a randomly chosen Pokémon and prompted to choose a stat (ID, height, or weight) tocompare with a randomly generated opponent Pokémon.
The winner of each round is determined by comparing the chosen stats,and the game continues for three rounds.
